all of the current configs in here are quite rough, couple need to be fixed since they were broken due to updates (namely yabai).

sketchybar should be working pretty good but it's not complete, there's a lot more functionality i want to add.

firefox css is pretty janky right now but it looks alright so long as you don't care about the new tab page:sweat:

peep `wallpapers/`'s README for wallpaper previews <3
